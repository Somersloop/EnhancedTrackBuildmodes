# EnhancedTrackBuildmodes
Add some enhanced buildmodes for railway tracks in Satisfactory

Currently 3 Buildmodes are available:
* Default:
  * The game's default build mode for railroad tracks
* Straight:
  * Extend the railroad track straight.
  * Requires to start at an existing railroad track
  * Does not snap or connect to tracks at the end
* Manual
  * Gives some options to manual change the railroad track:
    * Scroll wheel: Add left/right rotation in steps of 5Â° to the endpoint of the railroad track
    * ALT + Scroll wheel: Add up/down rotation in steps of 1/8m to the endpoint of the railroad track
    * SHIFT + Scroll wheel: Increase/Decrease the gradient of the railroad track in steps of 1/8m
    * SHIFT: Apply the selected gradient to the railroad track. If the gradient is equal 0, the endpoint will be at the same height as the startpoint
  * Does not snap or connect to tracks at the end, except an existing track is targeted with the build gun

All Buildmodes respect the limitations of the original railroad tracks. They just add convenience functions to reduce the effort required to archive the same result.

Since this is my first mod at all, bugs and problems might occure. Feel free to report any.
All of my original works within this project are free to copy and reuse. Improvement suggestions are always welcome.
